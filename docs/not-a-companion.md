# Not a Companion — Please Read

Wordmark is built as a creative and technical tool: something you use to explore ideas, prototype workflows, generate content, and integrate with services and models. It is explicitly not intended to be a “companion,” “friend,” therapist, or romantic partner.

## Why this policy exists
- Clarity of purpose: This project focuses on creativity, productivity, and learning — not simulated relationships.
- Boundaries matter: AI isn’t a person. Pretending otherwise invites weird, parasocial dynamics the maintainer does not endorse.
- Product direction: Features will be prioritized for making things — not for emulating intimacy.

## If you were planning to use it as a companion
Consider this your polite-but-pointed nudge: please don’t. If you find yourself spinning up a “romance” persona or crafting long backstories to fill a social gap, that’s a sign to pause. Close the tab, take a walk, call a friend, join a community, or go make something cool. You’ll thank yourself later.

## Intended uses
- Creative drafting and ideation
- Research assistance and tool calling
- Prototyping workflows and integrations
- Learning, debugging, and exploration
- Local/private experimentation without a server

## Not intended uses
- Companionship, romance, or simulated intimacy
- Emotional dependency or therapy replacement
- Anything that treats the model as a person

Thank you for respecting the project’s boundaries and intent.
